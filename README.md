Additional JavaDoc-Tags


Goals:
------

This small library mainly serves for improvements of the JavaDoc of Time4J but might also be useful for any other java project. Three extra tags are offered:

- doctags.concurrency (documents the concurrency behaviour of a class)
- doctags.spec (documents a specification requirement)
- doctags.exclude (excludes a program element from public API and JavaDoc)
